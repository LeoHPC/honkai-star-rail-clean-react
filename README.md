#### This project is about the launch of the new game from Mihoyo: Honkai Star Rail, and it was made to improve my skills in clean architecture, clean code, unitary tests, design pattern, storybook and accessibility.

The application is quite simple, showing some data of my favorite characters of the game until now. It is responsive and have a modern design, with some cool effects made with TailwindCSS and HeadlessUI.

All rules of clean architecture was respected and tested, as you see in the image and table below:
